# Landmarks
This is a project including what I have learned.

# Dataset
You need to mkdir a folder named 'Dataset' in Landmarks, and pur folder 'WLFW' in it.

# Run
First, you need to change _root.py to write your file location.

Then, you can open ../experiences/resnet18_baseline.py to change super parameters.

Finally, you can run train.py

# Test
After 59 epoches, run _test.py to test on Dataset for test. Also you can change the test set so that it can test for six subsets
