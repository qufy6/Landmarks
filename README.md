# Landmarks
This is a project including what I have learned.

# Run
To run the code, you need to change the root of files and make 2 new folders : 'trainimg' and 'testimg'.

And then you should run 'Train.py' and you will get a .pt file.

After that you can try to evaluate the model by running 'Test_6sub.py' to get the performences in 6 different situations.
